    "In `run_simulation.sh` we are looping over the four lambda directories and run an alchemical free energy calculation with the input. The executable is called `somd=freenrg` and forms part of Sire. The flag `-C` indicates the config file that is being passed, the flag `-c` the coordinate file `-t` the topology file and `-m` the morph file. The platform used for the simulation is indicated by `-p`. Normally it is advised to run simulations on GPUs and either use `CUDA` or `OpenCL` as a platform. These are currently not available on the cloud we are running on. For this reason we are using the VERY slow `CPU` platform. If you go back and want to actually run some meaningful simulations make sure these are done on GPUs such as the Nvidia GTX series. The last flag `-l` passes the current lambda value of the simulation.  \n",

    "We can now go ahead and run our short set of simulations. They should run for around 15 minutes. "
