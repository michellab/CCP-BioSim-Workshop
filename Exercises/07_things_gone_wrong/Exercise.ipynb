    "Although our predictions are quite far apart, the subsampling and discard show an improvement of about  1 kcal$\\cdot$mol$^{-1}$ on the final MBAR free energy estimation.  On the other side, TI fails to correctly predict the binding in this case. This is due to the noise present along the simulation, which greatly influences the free energy gradients values, thus the final free energy integration. Such a behaviour does not exist in MBAR, which is always consistent for all the evaluation process.\n",
    "Finally, it is worth to mention that this is just the first step toward accurate predictions. What w ehave obtained here is just a binding free energy $\\Delta G_\\mathrm{bind}$ which cannot be compared to the experimental value. Indeed, we are missing the definition of a standard state for the simulation, thus a standard state correction term for the free energy evaluation. Additionally, we should consider also Lennard Jones corrections and electrostatic finite size artefacts correction, which can remarkably improve the final free energy estimation."
